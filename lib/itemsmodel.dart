Baldwin agrees. “The best thing to do is try on many different options to see if you like joggers with elastic gathering at the ankles, drawstring pull ties to make them as tight as you want or a super wide leg like a great pair of cozy yoga pants.From bold and bright to all-neutral-everything, there are so many color options when it comes to today’s joggers. If you already have a strong style sensibility and feel pretty comfortable expressing yourself through fashion, Baldwin recommends trying all the colors. “Go as bright as you can!” If you’re on the more conservative side though, he suggests playing it safe with colors like khaki, gray (mainly charcoal), black, cream, olive and navy.",
